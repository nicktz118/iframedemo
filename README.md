# YouTubeIframeDemo


We used the library [IFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) inside of a WebView to interact with YouTube. We followed the reference on the document to implement the YouTube player. All behaviors of video are controlled by IFrame Player API (including advertisements), we donâ€™t interrupt any behavior when the video is playing. **It is 100% compliant with YouTube terms of service.** 

##### Below picture is the result of our experiment when we use Iframe API.
